# TikTok's Data Usage

This document will be going into two articles about the growth of TikTok and their usage of users' data.

## Article 1

In [TikTok Tracked User Data Using Tactic Banned by Google] (https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-tracked-user-data-using-tactic-banned-by-google-11597176738), the Wall Street Journal goes into how TikTok was using data tracing tactics that weren't allowed by Google. This is notable especially since Tiktok was already under strict coverage by the American government as a potential security threat. They go into certain technicalities such as MAC addresses, but note that the journal couldn't find that TikTok collected much unusual information such as that.

Obviously, this article paints Tiktok in a dangerous light. It says that TikTok is hard to read in terms of what they do with data and lacks security. As a TikTok user myself, this is a bit scary. However, the app remains to be a good source of entertainment for me. Also, it is noted that the method that Google banned was halted in November. Also, recently, I haven't heard much regarding TikTok being dangerous.

## Article 2

In [As the US gets ready to ban TikTok downloads, there is still no proof the app is spying on you for China] (https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-explainer-privacy-facebook-google-2020-7), businessinsider notes that while there was fear that Tiktok was a Chinese spying technique, there is no evidence for that idea. At this point, the US was getting ready to ban TikTok. However, this article says that TikTok was no worse than other social media such as Facebook or Google for both data collection and usage.

This article sheds some more optimism onto the state of TikTok. It fights against the reaction of the US government to TikTok as a threat to the country. This is more in line with what I hoped, as I would like to continue using TikTok without any concerns. However, this article also notes that other social media platforms that I use such as LinkedIn and Reddit also use sketchy tactics that have been cracked down upon. It opened my eyes to the dangers of data and how its a normalized thing in a sense among these large companies.
